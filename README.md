# Yolov3 Traffic Violations - Helmet Detection and ANPR

This application is an automated system of traffic monitoring to detect helmet violations. The system for 
detecting wrong side driving violations is implemented in YOLOv4 in 
[this repo](https://github.com/sriramcu/yolov4_wrong_side_driving_detection). The program 
automatically generates traffic violation tickets (or challans) based on registration details added to the 
database.

## High level overview

[BlcaKHat/yolov3-Helmet-Detection](https://github.com/BlcaKHat/yolov3-Helmet-Detection) already takes care of 
detecting and counting number of people wearing helmets in an image. 
[qqwweee/keras-yolo3](https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3) was trained on a dataset containing people and 
bikes but not helmets. 

* Our project aims to combine the two functionalities to avoid detecting violations for 
pedestrians not wearing helmets or scooters that are parked with no helmet. 
* It also detects violations where a helmet is present but not worn, for instance hanging on the side of a bike.
* The program detects a violation only if a helmet's bounding box is inside that of a person's and the person's 
  bounding box is inside that of a bike's.
* These violations are cropped out of the overall video frame to the combined dimension of the bike's and the 
  person's bounding boxes with some buffer and stored inside cropped_images folder inside keras_yolo3 folder.
* The ANPR program is run on these images and stored into violations folder inside keras_yolo3 folder.
* A challan is generated for each violation by referencing the vehicles.db sqlite3 database stored in 
  the root directory of the project using the license plate of the vehicle and is stored in challans 
  folder in the root directory of the project.
* Before running the helmet detection program, vehicle data is assumed to have been entered via the GUI, i.e. 
  vehicle license plates, name and address of the owner (3 columns).
